# GamePathFinder
## A simple Pathfinding algorithm extended with a compass  
Compass is just, that in every step it knows in which direction the goal is.
I ported the code to VB from a Delphi-code I found on the Internet around the year 2000.
I do not know the homepage anymore, guess it was a homepage of a programming teacher.
Just added some buttons and the compass-feature, otherwise it very much looks like the original. 
Green is land, like walking on green grass, grey are rocks like not-climbable mountains.
The compass-feature maybe looks like "cheating", but it is so sad to watch it missing 
the goal even if it is just one step away
Project started in June 2007
